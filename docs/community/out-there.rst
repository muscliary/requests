Integrations
============

ScraperWiki
------------

ScraperWiki is an excellent service that allows you to run Python, Ruby, and PHP
scraper scripts on the web. Now, Requests v0.6.1 is available to use in your scrapers!

To give it a try, simply::

    import requests


Managed Packages
================

Requests is available in a number of popular package formats. Of course,
the ideal way to install Requests is via The Cheeseshop.


Ubuntu & Debian
---------------

Requests is available installed as a Debian package! Debian Etch Ubuntu, since Oneiric::

    $ apt-get install

Unfortunately, the most recent version available is  v0.5.0. If you're on the
Debian Python Package team, I'd love an update of that :)


Fedora and RedHat
-----------------

You can easily install Requests v0.6.1 with yum on rpm-based systems::

    $ yum install python-requests
