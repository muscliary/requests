Requests has a great variety of powerful and useful third-party extensions.
This page provides an overview of some of the best of them.

CacheControl
------------

`CacheControl`_ is an extension that adds a full HTTP cache to requests. This
makes your web requests substantially more efficient, and should be used
whenever you're making a lot of web requests.

Requests-Oauthlib
-----------------

`requests-oauthlib`_ makes it possible to do the OAuth dance from requests
automatically. This is useful for the large number of websites that use OAuth
to provide authentication. It also provides a lot of tweaks that handle ways
that specific OAuth providers differ from the standard specifications.
