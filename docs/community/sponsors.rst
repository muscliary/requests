Community Sponsors
==================

**tl;dr**: Requests development is currently `funded by the Python community <https://www.kennethreitz.org/requests3>`_, and
some wonderful organizations that utilize the software in their businesses.

Requests is one of the most heavily–utilized Python packages in the world.

It is used by major corporations worldwide for all tasks, both small and large — from writing one–off scripts to orchestrating millions of dollars of critical infrastructure.

It's even embedded within pip, that tool that you use to install packages and deploy with every day!

After losing our primary open source maintainer (who was sponsored by a company to work on Requests, and other projects, full–time), we are seeking community financial contributions towards the development of Requests 3.0.

Patron Sponsors
----------------

We don't have any patrons yet — this slot is reserved for ethical organizations willing to invest $10,000 or more in Requests per year.

By becoming a patron, your organization will receive the following benefits:

- Priminent placement on the Requests documentation sidebar (~11,000 uniques / day).
- Honorable mention here, with logo.
- Peace of mind knowing that the infrastructure you rely on is being actively maintained.

Organizations that sign up (if any decide to) will be listed in order — first come first serve!

Major Contibutors
-----------------

Heroku
//////

Heroku has allowed Kenneth Reitz to work on open source projects for work,
including Requests (but mostly Pipenv), from time–to–time, so they are listed
here as an honorable mention.

Slack — Bring your team together
////////////////////////////////

Slack has generously donated a large sum towards the `2018 Requests 3.0 fundraiser <https://www.kennethreitz.org/requests3>>`_,
and is helping the world become a better place through connectiveness, and reducing the amount of email we all have
to deal with on a daily basis.
